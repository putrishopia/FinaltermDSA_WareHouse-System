In this Data Structure & Algorithm final project, our group created a warehouse management system that implements topics from before midterm (linked list and pointer), after midterm (stacks), and arranged the program in class format. Based on the input given, the program can perform basic functions of stacks such as push (insertion of item), pop (deletion of Last-In item), peek (find specific item in stacks), and destroy (reset stacks). 

Disclaimer:

- Please run the program by copy-paste code to IDE. We often encounter unexpected errors when running the code with file format.

- Even though each file was given to a separate member, everyone nevertheless contributed to the creation of the entire program because each member of our team wrote, updated, and integrated their own code during the process.
